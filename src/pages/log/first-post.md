# Welcome to my development log

This is the first entry in my engineering log. Here I will document my journey,
technical challenges, and solutions I encounter while building systems.

## Project Structure

The project is built with **Astro** and uses a custom component-based architecture
to mimic a VSCode environment.

## Goals for 2026

1. Master advanced distributed systems patterns
2. Contribute to open source projects
3. Build more cool stuff like this site!

## Code Snippet

Here is a simple Hello World in Go:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

// Stay tuned for more updates.
